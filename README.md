## Branches
I am using these Branches for development and releases:
- Main: Used as Stable Fallback and has actual named relases (i.e they show up named if you go to build the config)
- Development: The general Development Branch, used to test Configs before mergin into main
- feat/fix/chore: General Branches using Conventional Commits to develop specific features, these are mainly based on the main branch
-
